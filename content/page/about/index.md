      The Simon Institute for Longterm Governance (SI)'s mission is to increase the capacity of policy networks to anticipate global catastrophic risks and build resilience for civilization to flourish. Based in Geneva, Switzerland, SI works with policy networks centered around the United Nations, the European Union and national governments to discreetly foster their cooperation with the future.

      Humanity is facing challenges of unprecedented scale, from emerging biotechnology to superhuman intelligence. Public policy-making - the processes of blending information and interests to govern societies - is crucial for the implementation of viable solutions and can be improved (or worsened).

      At SI, we envision a flourishing civilization safeguarded by systems that mitigate global catastrophic risks.

      SI’s tools and advice - anchored in the state of the art in behavioural science - help decision-makers cope with uncertainty, competing objectives and the glut of information.

      ### Institutional support

      We develop training programs and advise actors in policy networks with a focus on improving the collective capacity to process information and coordinate in a timely manner.

      ### Field-building

      We aggregate and communicate strategic insights within a network of longtermist policy actors to strengthen coordination, research and policy engagement.

      ### Research

      We seek to understand political decision-making by synthesising knowledge, formally modelling system dynamics and empirically testing models and hypotheses through experimentation.

      ### Value-driven

      An oscillatory yet upward trend characterizes the quality of life on earth. Despite harmful events such as large-scale epidemics and world wars, human civilization seems to progressively reach better equilibria. People are living longer and better, which suggests the future could be even better - and bigger. But with new capabilities come new risks.

      ### Risk-focused

      The existence of future generations with lives worth living depends on our civilization’s ability to safeguard them from global catastrophic risks. To better manage low-probability, high-impact events, it is important to improve adaptive decision-making in political institutions.

      Governmental and international institutions are crucial for resilience because policy-making facilitates large-scale action with longterm impacts. Designing effective longterm policy is difficult, however. High levels of uncertainty characterize our understanding of the drivers and effects of global challenges and how best to handle them. Policy-making consists of a myriad of actors with competing goals, imperfectly aggregating local information and concerns into collective outcomes. Humans have not evolved to coordinate around global issues in ways that would optimize longterm outcomes.

      ### Science-based

      Complementary to those who study the nature of global catastrophic risks, we focus on collective decision-making processes in policy networks to mitigate risks. We are uniting knowledge on public policy-making processes, human behaviour, the nature of risks, the drivers of resilience and the interface of science and policy.

      Herbert Simon (1916 - 2001) was a political scientist, cognitive psychologist, computer scientist and economist.

      His research represents most of the knowledge SI is building on and aims to contribute to.

      He formalized the concept of bounded-rationality, i.e. that humans make decisions under uncertainty with cognitive constraints. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 and the Turing Award in 1975. He is known for having seminally contributed to the fields of behavioural economics, public administration, complexity science and artificial intelligence.

      We thank Katherine, Peter and Barbara Simon for having granted us the honour of naming the Institute for Longterm Governance after their father.
