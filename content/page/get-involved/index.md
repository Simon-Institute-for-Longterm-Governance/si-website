      To meaningfully support policy networks without just injecting further noise into the system, we have to build capacity over multiple years. With a team of three FTE until 2022 and five the following year, our current room for more funding until the end of 2022 is at least CHF 545,000.

      ### Understanding and scaling longterm governance

      Improving international policy systems and their impact requires a detailed understanding of their functioning. Our research pioneers formal and validated models that enable systematic experimentation.

      ### Risk-aware and collaborative

      Multilateral policy-making affects large populations - for the better or worse. Aware of downside- risks, we test out ideas cautiously and only scale programs which all our stakeholders deem robustly beneficial.

      ### Impact-multiplier

      Our existing networks within international organizations, the EU, civil society and academia allow us to bring together actors who otherwise struggle cooperating. We increase the productivity of their interaction.
