    title: Knowledge Synthesis
    description: We synthesize knowledge, creating reports, briefings, and
      presentations at the intersection of long-term governance, technology
      governance, and multilateralism. We translate complex scientific,
      technological and policy concepts into accessible language, to ensure that
      decision-makers understand and act on policy-relevant developments
      effectively.

    title: Policy Support
    description: We inform multilateral policy processes, especially via the UN and
      OECD systems, through written recommendations, panel engagements, and
      specialized advice to policy actors. We focus on processes that promote
      long-term thinking, enhance risk mitigation, and strengthen global
      technology governance.
