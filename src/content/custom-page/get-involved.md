      SI’s mission and approach resonate with current trends and demands in policy networks. Our discreet support and longterm focus make us a uniquely trustworthy ally for change.


      ### Multilateral


      We build cooperation between important actors with competing preferences by facilitating mutual understanding, information exchange, collective prioritization and learning.
