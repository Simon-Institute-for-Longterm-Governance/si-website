  intro: |
    To meaningfully support policy networks without just injecting further noise into the system, we have to build capacity sustainably. With a team of three FTE until 2022 and five the following year, our current room for more funding until the end of 2022 is at least CHF 545,000.

    Until we have received legal nonprofit status, you can donate to Effective Altruism Geneva - an established Swiss nonprofit organization supporting our launch.

    content: |
      ### Understanding and scaling longterm governance

      Improving international policy systems and their impact requires a detailed understanding of their functioning. Our work pioneers systematic experimentation.

      ### Risk-aware and collaborative

      Policy-making affects large populations for the better or worse. We test our ideas cautiously and scale only if all our stakeholders deem a project robustly beneficial.

      ### Impact-multiplier

      We build cooperation between important actors with conflicting preferences by facilitating mutual understanding, information exchange and collective prioritization.
