      ### Mission		

      SI's mission is to increase the capacity of policy networks to anticipate global catastrophic risks and build resilience for civilization to flourish.

      ### Vision		

      At SI, we envision a flourishing civilization safeguarded by systems that mitigate global catastrophic risks.
      
      ### Why?
      
      From biotechnology to the development of superhuman intelligence, humanity is facing emerging challenges of unprecedented scale. The existence of future generations with lives worth living depends on our civilizationâ€™s ability to safeguard them from such global catastrophic risks. But the multilateralism needed to govern these low-probability, high-impact events is currently out of sight.
      
      ### How?
      
      As a non-profit, SI can afford to focus on the longterm. We connect research with practice to support a risk- and resilience-focused multilateralism enhanced by science. Our tools, knowledge and community help international policy networks cope with complexity, uncertainty, competing objectives and the glut of information. Based in Geneva, Switzerland, we support policy networks centered around the United Nations, the European Union and national governments to discreetly foster their cooperation with the future.
      
      ### Policy networks?		
      
      A wide range of actors inside and outside of political institutions contributes to the creation of policy, including elected officials, bureaucrats, academics, civil society, lobbyists and more. It is this co-creation process that SI seeks to support.

      ### Policy support 
      
      We develop training programs and advise actors in policy networks with a focus on improving the collective capacity to exchange information and coordinate in a timely manner.

      ### Field-building

      We build research collaborations and strengthen policy decisions by coordinating a network of longtermist policy-makers and researchers who share knowledge and strategic insights.

      ### Research

      We seek to better understand policy-making by synthesising knowledge, formalizing system dynamics and empirically testing our hypotheses and tools for validity and usefulness.

      ### Value-driven

      Human civilization is progressively reaching better equilibria. Despite shocks, such as large-scale epidemics and world wars, people today are living longer and healthier than ever before. This progressive trend suggests that the future could be even better. We work to increase the chances of that happening.

      ### Risk-focused

      Global catastrophic risks have the potential to curtail our civilization's future and or reverse past progress. To build resilience to the most extreme shocks, humanity has to achieve resolute multilateral action. We support policy networks contributing to the governance of low-proability high-impact events.

      ### Science-based

      Complementary to those researching the nature of global catastrophic risks, we research the dynamics of the relevant policy networks. We unite knowledge on policy processes, human behaviour and extreme risks to test hypotheses for improving the relationship between research and policy to achieve resilience.

    Herbert Simon (1916 - 2001) was a political scientist, cognitive psychologist, computer scientist and economist.

    His research represents much of the knowledge SI is building on and aims to contribute to.

    Herbert formalized the concept of bounded-rationality, i.e. that humans make decisions under uncertainty with cognitive constraints. In 1978, he received the Nobel Prize in Economics and a Turing Award in 1975. He is known for having seminally contributed to the fields of behavioural economics, public administration, complexity science and artificial intelligence.

    We thank Katherine, Barbara and Peter Simon for having granted us the honour of naming the Institute for Longterm Governance after their father.
