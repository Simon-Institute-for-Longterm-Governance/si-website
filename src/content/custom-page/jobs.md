title: Open positions
intro: >-
  We are always looking for highly dedicated colleagues to build an extraordinary team with. We currently do not have any open positions but if you think you'd be a great fit, do send in a general application.


  We are committed to developing a diverse team. To build a thriving and resilient organizational culture, we especially encourage applications from women, gender minorities, people of color, and regions outside of Europe or North America. We are committed to being an equal opportunity employer and will invest heavily into team-building to gain strength from diversity.


  If you are excited about contributing to our mission, please apply - the first stage should take no more than 30 minutes. The second stage is a work test, and the third is a series of 2-4 interviews. The fourth and final stage is a work trial. We pay all candidates $60 per hour invested beyond the initial application and cover all eventual travel and accommodation expenses. We will also offer feedback to all candidates who make it to the interview round.


  Referral reward: We offer $2000 to anyone who refers a candidate to us that we end up hiring and who would otherwise not have been likely to apply. Get in touch to register your referral.
