    The Simon Institute for Longterm Governance (SI) is somewhere between a research lab and a training centre, founded and
    nourished by a community of researchers and policy-makers.

    We are building the knowledge and community to improve the
    global governance of catastrophic risks.

    Our work is guided by a vision of governance tools and practices
    that account for future generations, facilitated by advances in
    research and attitudes.

    As we're a non-profit, we can afford to focus on the longterm.
