Konrad is SI's chief operating officer and co-founder. He leads operations, events, fundraising, and culture.

Previously, he developed [Effective Altruism Geneva](https://eageneva.org/) into a nation-wide association, where he now serves on the board. Konrad has successfully advised hundreds of talented individuals on their donations and career - and continues to do so in his free time.

Konrad dropped out of a bachelorâ€™s in international relations after receiving funding to professionalize Effective Altruism Geneva. His interests include sociology, ethics, psychology, epistemology, and game theory. In his free time, he likes to discuss, meditate, dance, and make music.
