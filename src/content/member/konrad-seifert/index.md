Konrad is a co-founder of SI. Together with Max, he develops our strategy, designs programs, builds products, and nourishes SI's ecosystem.

Previously, Konrad co-founded and led [Effective Altruism Switzerland](https://effectivealtruism.ch/), developing theories of change with philanthropists and entrepreneurs. He now serves on the association's board of directors, overseeing an annual budget of over one million Swiss Francs.

Konrad grew disillusioned with the scholarship in international relations and dropped out to focus on independent projects. His interests include organizational behavior, epistemology, and development economics.
