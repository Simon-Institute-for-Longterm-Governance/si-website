Konrad is SI's chief operating officer and co-founder. He leads operations, events, fundraising, and culture.

Previously, he developed the student association Effective Altruism (EA) Geneva into [a nation-wide association](https://effectivealtruism.ch/) with employees and a stable funding base. He now serves on EA Switzerland's board and continues to advise hundreds of talented individuals on their donations and career.

Konrad dropped out of a bachelorâ€™s in international relations after receiving funding to professionalize EA Geneva. His interests include sociology, ethics, psychology, epistemology, and game theory. In his free time, he likes to discuss, meditate, dance, and make music.
