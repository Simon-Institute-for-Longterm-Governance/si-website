Konrad is a co-founder of SI. Together with Max, he develops our strategy, designs programs, builds products and nourishes SI's ecosystem. 

Previously, Konrad co-founded [Effective Altruism Switzerland](https://effectivealtruism.ch/) (EA Switzerland), an association supporting philanthropists and entrepreneurs in giving effectively and building impactful projects. He is still actively involved in the community and serves on its board of directors.

After becoming disillusioned with the scholarship, Konrad dropped out of his bachelor's in international relations to focus on independent projects. His intellectual interests include sociology, ethics, psychology, epistemology, and game theory. In his free time, he enjoys productive discussions, writing, dancing, and making music.
