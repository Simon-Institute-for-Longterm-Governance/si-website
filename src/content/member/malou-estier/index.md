Malou is a law & policy associate. To advance the application of SI's ideas, she ensures legal applicability; researches international governance vehicles; and develops pedagogical approaches.

Prior to her work with SI, Malou graduated from Utrecht University with an LLM focusing on the law of the sea; was an International Coordinator at the European Youth Parliament.
