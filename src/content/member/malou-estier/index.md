Malou researches the legal implications of our ideas; analyses international processes; and supports the development of our pedagogical approaches.

Prior to her work with SI, Malou graduated from Utrecht University with an LLM focusing on the law of the sea, and was an International Coordinator at the European Youth Parliament.

In high school, Malou became concerned with pandemics and wrote a prescient book about a catastrophic outbreak in Geneva. Her interest in the governance of global public goods might be traced back to her appreciation of the seas, especially through sailing.
