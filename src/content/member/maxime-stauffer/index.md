Max is co-founder and chief executive officer of SI. Together with Konrad, he facilitates workshops, maintains partnerships, and evaluates performance. He leads our strategy and research. 

Max is a research fellow at the [Transformative Governance Lab](https://gtglab.net/team/) of the University of Geneva and a science-policy officer at the [Geneva Science-Policy Interface](https://gspi.ch/). Previously, he co-founded the [Social Complexity Lab](https://www.complexitylab.ch/) and [Effective Altruism Geneva](https://eageneva.org/), where he now serves on the board. 

In the past, he was a researcher at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, advised the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre on evidence-based policy-making, and obtained a Bachelor’s degree in International Relations from the University of Geneva. 

In parallel to his work, Max is pursuing an M.Sc. in Computational Math at Johns Hopkins University. His research interests revolve around decision-making in the face of complexity, including bounded-rationality and collective decision-making in policy contexts.
