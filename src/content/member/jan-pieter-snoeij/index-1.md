Jan Pieter is SIâ€™s Economics of AI Fellow, researching the economic and geopolitical implications of transformative AI. His work examines how AI will reshape global economic development and how global governance can guide this transition to maximize benefits while mitigating global risks.

His interest in understanding and improving subjective conscious experience has led to a diverse background, spanning work in international development on migration and education in West Africa and South America. He co-founded Effective Altruism Switzerland and contributed to research on policy processes and long-term governance that led to the creation of the Simon Institute.

Jan Pieter holds a graduate degree in Economics from the University of Amsterdam and studied Development Studies at the Geneva Graduate Institute.
