  - title: Policy support
    content: |
      Policy-making is characterized by uncertainty. We help you and your team grapple productively with it.

      ### Table-top exercises

      We help policy networks identify communication bottlenecks and equip them with tools to render tacit knowledge explicit and reduce information asymmetries.

      ### Mental models & heuristics

      We develop and train simple and efficient boosting techniques to help groups communicate information more effectively and prioritize faster.

      ### Decision support tools

      We provide training on tools to foster cooperation through deliberation, prioritization, transparency and consistency - and advise their implementation.
