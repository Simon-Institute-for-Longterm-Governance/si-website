      The Simon Institute for Longterm Governance (SI) is a think tank at the
      heart of the international system, seeking funding to strengthen the
      multilateral governance of transformative AI. 


      We could effectively leverage an additional **CHF 3MM to 4.3MM** until the end of 2026. Every contribution directly helps us maintain our independence and achieve sustained financial stability. **Our current plans** involve: 


      * Working with national representatives and UN Secretariats to support the development of an effective **International Scientific Panel on AI**; 

      * Supporting the internationalization of **the** **UK government’s seminal international AI safety efforts** (AIS Summits, AISI network, State of the Science Report); 

      * Working with the organizers and key stakeholders of the **Paris AI Action Summit** to harmonize governance efforts across national, regional, and international fora;

      * Collaborating with the **technical AI governance community** to improve its engagement with international processes.


      You can read more about our plans for the foreseeable future **[here](https://www.simoninstitute.ch/blog/post/si%E2%80%99s-post-summit-of-the-future-plans/)**, and more about our work in our **[monthly newsletter](https://us1.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=5d7bba8c78d25d980050b3a16&id=dfb580ce4c)**.
