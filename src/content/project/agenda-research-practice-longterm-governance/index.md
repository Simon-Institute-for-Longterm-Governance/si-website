      Looking forward, we suggest avenues for further reflection and
      experimentation to achieve longterm governance. First, we sketch
      approaches to building the field of longterm governance. While currently,
      we take a behavioural and social lens on understanding policy-making,
      future research may take a legal, narrative or computational lens, which
      can result in further contributions. We highlight the need to build
      capacity at the science-policy interface. As most vocal proponents of
      longtermism are academics, there is a need for actors who convert
      reflections and findings into policy change. Second, we articulate four
      key research avenues to further our understanding of policy-making. We
      include an evaluation of the impact of short-term policy-making on the
      long-term future; the evolution of social narratives; the mechanisms that
      drive policy-making; and the identification of robust leverage points for
      long-term policy change. Third, we provide recommendations for engaging in
      and improving policy-making, including trade-offs, risks, and a set of
      safe and experimental strategies.
