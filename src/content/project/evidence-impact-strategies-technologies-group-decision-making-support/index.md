      Policy-makers work on solving problems of high complexity. Scholars in decision sciences and policy analysis have explored numerous ways to support decision-making processes through information supply and tools that support decision-making processes. Research that assesses the usefulness and applicability of such strategies to enhance decision-making is scarce, however. Our review provides evidence-based recommendations for practice and further research. It also proposes a method to compare decision-making support strategies, which is important given the vast number and diversity of strategies. We apply the developed method to analyse the reported impact and state of evidence of strategies highlighted in expert interviews.
