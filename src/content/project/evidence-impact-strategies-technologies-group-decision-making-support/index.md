      Policy-makers work on solving problems of high complexity. Scholars in
      decision sciences and policy analysis have explored numerous ways to
      support decision-making processes through information supply and tools
      that support decision-making processes. Research that assesses the
      usefulness and applicability of such strategies to enhance decision-making
      is scarce, however. Our review provides evidence-based recommendations for
      practice and further research. It also proposes a method to compare
      decision-making support strategies, which is important given the vast
      number and diversity of strategies. We apply the developed method to
      analyse the reported impact and state of evidence of strategies
      highlighted in expert interviews.
