  - title: Summary
    content: Long-term Governance is a young field with much room for growth.
      Policymakers and researchers often lack opportunities for focused and
      productive exchange. Our aim is to curate a community that is united in
      the aim to research and implement ways to safeguard the lives and freedom of 
      future generations. We increase bandwidth between actors of different 
      backgrounds but with shared goals through targeted outreach, a chat server,
      resource repositories and themed retreats.

      We use Zulip for communication. It's like Slack but with proper threading
      - a great mix between a chat and a forum that won't flood your email
      inbox. You can join streams for topical discussions, share updates, job
      postings and more. You can also have private chats - one-on-one or in
      groups.


      Once we have confirmed your sign-up, you will be able to log into [longtermgov.zulipchat.com](https://longtermgov.zulipchat.com/) via your browser or [the app for your phone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zulipmobile).
