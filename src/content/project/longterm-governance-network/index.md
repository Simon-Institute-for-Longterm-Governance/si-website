      To build a strong community of practice in long-term governance, we invite
      policymakers, diplomats, researchers and grantmakers to join our network.


      If you think you could be a great addition, [fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shrdAb3PgjzY49EeZ) and we'll be in touch.

      We use Zulip for communication. It's like Slack but with proper threading
      - a great mix between a chat and a forum that won't flood your email
      inbox. You can join streams for topical discussions, share updates, job
      postings and more. You can also have private chats - one-on-one or in
      groups.


      Once signed up, you can log in using your browser or [the app for your phone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zulipmobile&hl=en_US) at [longtermov.zulipchat.com](https://longtermov.zulipchat.com).




      ### New to Zulip?


      [Here's the user guide.](https://zulipchat.com/help/getting-started-with-zulip) You can:


      * Join and create new streams (there’s a cog next to “Streams” in the left panel, if clicked, a tab in the pop-up window shows “All streams”, as well as a “+” to create new ones)

      * “Star” (favourite) entire streams to see at the top of your list

      * Flag (“star” again) single messages to save them/respond later

      * Silence single topics or entire streams if you need a break

      * Get email notifications for particular people, topics or streams


      Pro-tip: liberally use emoticons as reactions - that way others get feedback even if you don't write a comment.


      Please, fill out your account profile with at least your first name, a profile picture and a short bio. That makes it easier to get a feel for who’s who.
