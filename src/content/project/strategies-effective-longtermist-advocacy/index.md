      Using a complex systems lens, we answer the following question: how can
      one engage in such a system to robustly benefit the long-term future?
      While existing research provides provisional answers on what could feature
      on the agenda of longtermist advocates, little progress has been made on
      how to design and implement agendas. We address this gap of translating
      research insights into direct engagement with policy processes. We provide
      an overview of what advocates must understand and build to have a positive
      impact, divided into two main sections. First, we review the literature on
      advocacy, lobbying and epistemic communities to identify best practices in
      policy engagement, notably including advice on how academics can
      constructively collaborate with policy actors. Second, we provide a
      framework, grounded in the literature, to guide longtermist advocacy:
      delineating considerations, guiding questions, and pieces of advice for
      effective engagement. We conclude with limitations and notes of caution on
      the use of the aforementioned framework.
