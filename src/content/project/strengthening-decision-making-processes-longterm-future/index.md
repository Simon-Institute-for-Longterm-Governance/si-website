      At the core of policy-making lie decision-making processes. Building on
      our previous work, we delve into ways to facilitate them to benefit
      long-term resilience. Decision-making has a number of correlates, such as
      judgement, behaviour, emotion, cognition and social cues. We synthesise
      different bodies of literature that have provided insight into how these
      correlates can be understood, handled and improved. First, we synthesise
      the characteristics of decision-making in policy contexts and, in
      particular, why they are different from average situations. We provide an
      account of the characteristics of policy problems, as well as the
      particular challenges of long-term policy problems, such as moral
      uncertainty and slow feedback loops. Second, we build on findings in
      political neuroscience and behavioural public policy to explain why
      decision-making tends to be short-termist. Third, based on the above, we
      provide guidance for decision-making support: we advocate moving away from
      prioritizing the supply of information and towards focusing on information
      processing instead, switching from individual to collective support and
      privileging tools for complex problem-solving over nudging; and provide
      recent evidence on the usefulness of practical strategies to support
      decision-making in policy contexts in particular. Fourth, we explain how
      to select strategies as a function of the context and the evaluation
      thereof.
