  - title: The problem
    content: |
      Limited resources, inifinite problems and even more opinions. Policy problems are complex and evidence rarely convinces everybody. Preferences diverge and people bias each other. 

      Where do we start? What matters most? Questions that feel impossible to answer. And yet, not answering them also provides an answer: we let chance decide - or whoever screams the loudest.

      Unless we tackle the hard questions, future generations will look back at us and just see dart-throwing, chest-beating monkeys.

      Coordination most often fails when at least one of the parties feels like they aren't being listened to or are risking too much if somebody else ends up defecting. 

      Decision-making in itself is only risky if we can't justify our process.

      Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) helps to take into account competing preferences, make judgment calls transparent and enables to remember and learn from past decision-making processes.

      We propose an introductory workshop to one of the best research-backed tools out there.

      Political decision-making, the process by which actors blend information, resources and interests into outcomes, is subject to at least three difficulties:

      1. Prioritization
      International organizations, governments and non-governmental organizations have limited resources. They cannot choose and fund all policy or programme proposals. This means that the actors who participate directly or indirectly in resource allocation must decide which proposals to drop and which to keep. They must do so according to large numbers of alternatives and often multiple goals. Typically, they must satisfy beneficiaries, different local contexts, donors, different objectives (often multiple SDG targets), and must account for constraints and interconnections with other policies. This process is tedious as it requires an overview as well as an in-depth understanding of both policy proposals and goals.

      2. Collective decision-making
      In policy contexts, decisions are often made by groups and in consultation with stakeholders. While groups and consultations allow decision-makers to understand different perspectives, they also exacerbate the difficulties linked to prioritization. Individuals and organizations operate in different contexts, may have different values and approaches, and likely have different preferences. Moreover, groups exhibit additional biases, such as groupthink, or tend to make suboptimal decisions in the presence of information asymmetries. Therefore, decision-making groups need strategies to account for the collective nature of policy decisions.

      3. Complexity & uncertainty
      Decision-making groups face incomplete information. They need strategies to identify best guesses and make decisions regardless of the state of evidence. Ideally, they integrate scientific evidence or advice in their decision-making but the question is how? Which parts of the decision require evidence? How to deal with quantitative and qualitative evidence? Lastly, decision-making groups can reduce uncertainty over time if they adequately learn from past decisions. Therefore, they need strategies to make explicit decisions, state hypotheses, document their process, and update their thinking and approach as a function of new knowledge.

      ### Relevance for International Geneva

      Teams within United Nations agencies need to make decisions at a global level which must satisfy different national contexts, different stakeholders (donors, beneficiaries), and different goals (SDGs). There is a lot of external work supporting formal UN negotiations, especially conducted by operational agencies who develop policy programmes. Except for WHO’s guideline production process, it is not clear which process these agencies follow, and which tools they use. Initial interactions with UN agencies have shown a strong interest in tools (instead of or in addition to evidence) to understand and improve their decision-making processes.

      Solution: multi-criteria decision analysis for evidence-based prioritization

      MCDA refers to a set of methods to account for multiple objectives and options with the goal of explicitly prioritizing the best option (Watrobski et al., 2019). All MCDA methods have four steps: (1) identify selection criteria, their weights and metrics; (2) identify options; (3) rate the performance of each option per criterion; (4) determine preferences by aggregating a score for each option and comparing results (Kapiriri et al., 2017). This analysis technique has been applied for almost a century and to thousands of cases. A core contribution from operations research, MCDA’s most valuable feature may be that it can transparently account for conflicting preferences, as is often the case in policy-making (Esmail et al., 2018).

      MCDA is not only a tool. It is also a way of thinking that contributes to mindset changes. For instance, MCDA incentivises actors to acknowledge uncertainty, express confidence in their assessment, cultivates explicit reasoning and communication, and trains individuals in making hard choices in situations of resource scarcity.

      ### Usefulness of MCDA according to the latest research

      Despite difficulties in implementing MCDAs, the research is clear about its value for decision-making support in policy context. It facilitates the scoring of an often vast option space on competing decision-relevant criteria. It structures the exploration of possible scenarios, provides a formatted overview, enables replicability and psychological comfort while highlighting knowledge gaps and laying the necessary groundwork to update current assumptions. As a result, stakeholder relationships become more structured and transparent, increasing trust (Montibeller et al., 2020; Watrobski, 2019; Glaize et al., 2019).

      MCDA’s usefulness in collective decision-making is due to the capacity to account for multidimensional problems, quantitative and qualitative data, competing interests and differing judgments. Its vast applications have proven its adaptability and employability across cultures and domains to make better choices and systematically learn from them (Cohen et al., 2019; Esmail et al., 2018). Compared to other popular strategies, MCDA performs best in terms of evidence-base and impact-potential.
