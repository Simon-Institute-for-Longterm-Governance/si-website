      Policy process studies have converged on the view that policy-making
      systems satisfy the hallmarks of complexity systems. However, existent
      research only rarely uses the methods appropriate for the investigation of
      complex systems - computational models - or is almost entirely detached
      from existing theory of policy processes. This gap separates social
      scientists and computational scientists who share the same goal. We build
      on the theories of policy processes and computational sciences to advance
      the computational turn of policy process studies. Beyond examining why and
      how complexity science lends itself in the study of policy-making, we
      present a process to guide computational modelling projects, sketch the
      contours of a toolbox to model social networks and adaptive political
      behaviour, and articulate avenues for further research. Overall, we
      encourage a computational turn of policy process studies that is
      empirical, hypothesis-driven and results from the joint effort of the
      social and computational sciences communities.
