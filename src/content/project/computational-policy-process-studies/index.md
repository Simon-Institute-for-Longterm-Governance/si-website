      Policy process studies have converged on the view that policy-making systems satisfy the hallmarks of complexity systems. However, existent research only rarely uses the methods appropriate for the investigation of complex systems - computational models - or is almost entirely detached from existing theory of policy processes. This gap separates social scientists and computational scientists who share the same goal. We build on the theories of policy processes and computational sciences to advance the computational turn of policy process studies. Beyond examining why and how complexity science lends itself in the study of policy-making, we present a process to guide computational modelling projects, sketch the contours of a toolbox to model social networks and adaptive political behaviour, and articulate avenues for further research. Overall, we encourage a computational turn of policy process studies that is empirical, hypothesis-driven and results from the joint effort of the social and computational sciences communities.
