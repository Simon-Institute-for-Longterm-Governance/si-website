      The past three decades of policy process studies have seen the emergence
      of a clear intellectual lineage with regard to complexity. Implicitly or
      explicitly, scholars have employed complexity theory to examine the
      intricate dynamics of collective action in political contexts. However,
      the methodological counterparts to complexity theory – such as
      computational methods – are rarely used and, even if, often detached from
      established policy process theory. 


      Our aim is to promote a computational turn of policy process studies that is empirical and hypothesis-driven. To that end, we lead research collaborations that build bridges between two distant fields: computational modeling and policy process studies.

      **A Computational Turn in Policy Process Studies: Co-evolving Network
      Dynamics of Policy Change**


      Building on a critical review of the application of complexity theory to policy process studies, we present and implement a baseline model of policy processes using the logic of co-evolving networks. Our model suggests that an actors’ influence depends on their environment and on exogenous events facilitating dialogue and consensus-building. Our results validate previous opinion dynamics models and generate novel patterns. Our discussion provides ground for further research and outlines the path for the field to achieve a computational turn.

      While policy process theory has converged on the view that policymaking
      can be studied as a complex system, the literature has only minimally used
      the methodological complement to the theory - experiments performed with
      computational models. Implementations are rare, mainly pushed by computer
      scientists in trans-disciplinary work and often so detached from
      mainstream theory that they form a separate line of research instead of
      testing theories from the social sciences.


      This paper builds on the theory of policy processes and computational sciences to advance the computational turn of policy process studies. We examine how and why complexity science lends itself to study policymaking, propose a workflow to guide the creation of computational policy process models, describe the contours of a computational approach to policy process modeling and define goals for future research that follow from this computational turn.

  description: This paper builds on the theory of policy processes and
    computational sciences to advance the computational turn of policy process
    studies. We examine how and why complexity science lends itself to study
    policymaking, propose a workflow to guide the creation of computational
    policy process models, describe the contours of a computational approach to
    policy process modeling and define goals for future research that follow
    from this computational turn. Overall, we aim to promote a computational
    turn of policy process studies that is empirical and hypothesis-driven.
