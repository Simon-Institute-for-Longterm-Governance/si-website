  - title: The problem
    content: |
      Facing wicked problems, more information rarely solves the essential problem we humans face: the outcomes of our actions are impossible to predict with certainty. Even if we understood a problem, there would never be a perfect solution as parameters keep changing.

      To understand our constantly changing environment, insurmountable amounts of information products are sent our way. But most of analyses lack the rigour to be conclusive. And when we search for high quality syntheses, they aren't tailored to our specific needs and often hidden behind paywalls.

      Given our limited time to act, we have to make decisions based on our current understanding of the world. But how to make well-informed guesses in fast-paced environments that perform better than chance and allow us to learn from them?
