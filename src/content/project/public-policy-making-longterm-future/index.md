      The moral view of longtermism underscores the importance of coordinating societies across space and time. Policy-making processes in local and national governments and international organizations are the current most advanced form of explicit, value-based coordination. They foster coordination and affect citizens across the world. The same processes, however, suffer from constraints limiting their benefit to future generations, resulting in political short-termism. In this paper, we propose improvements to policy-making processes that could remedy shortcomings and unlock its full potential. We propose to build on existing structures for the creation of longterm value. We propose five concrete improvements, structured according to an implementation framework and guided by a vision. We introduce the framework of resilience, incorporating an understanding of systems, risks and collapse scenarios, to guide policy-making processes. We present a vision for policy-making that embodies the implications of the resilience framework for policy-making processes, unpacked into the need to shape a societal narrative based on resilience thinking; to give a voice to future generations by reforming institutional structures; and to build policy agendas that account for tail-risks, their correlates and the properties of resilient systems: prevent, mitigate and adapt. To achieve this vision, we present five improvements to decision-making processes. They consist of (1) fostering moral action, (2) building systems thinking abilities, (3) improving evidence synthesis, (4) developing decision-making support technologies, and (5) incentivizing group decision-making.
