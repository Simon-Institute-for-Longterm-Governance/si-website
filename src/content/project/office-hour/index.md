  - title: Summary
    content: Long-term Governance is a young field with much room for growth. To
      motivate further investment, research, and application, we happily share
      our experiences and thoughts. We have given talks on our work at
      institutions such as the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk or the
      Global Priorities Institute. We also host a monthly office hour for casual
      exchange, participate actively in various conferences relevant to our
      work, and document relevant reflections on our blog.
  - content: If you're interested in our work and network, we invite you to join our
      monthly office hour. We meet every first Wednesday of the month from
      12:30-13:30 (Genevan time). [Join us with this
