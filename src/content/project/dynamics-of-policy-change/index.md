      Any attempts to improve policy-making will have to grapple with complexity. Policy-making consists of a myriad of actors whose multifarious interactions lead to policy change. These dynamics are nonlinear, co-evolutionary, stochastic and context-specific. We provide four mental models that help policy-makers to navigate the complexities of policy-making more easily. First, the power-law of public budgets helps adjust expectations regarding policy change: it suggests that policy change is rare and incremental, yet occasionally sudden and radical. Few instances of policy change account for most changes over decades. Second, we describe three categories of determinants of change within policy networks: three determinants at the actor level - beliefs, bounded-rationality and emotions;  three determinants at the collective level - networks, coalitions and ambiguity; and three exogenous determinants - institutional structures, focusing events and public opinion. These determinants give an overview of what shapes the social processes of policy-making. Third, we explain two core mechanisms of policy change: policy entrepreneurship and policy learning. Fourth, we distil four potential leverage points to trigger policy change from all of the above. Altogether, the provided mental models are essential contributions to the toolbox of longtermist advocates.
