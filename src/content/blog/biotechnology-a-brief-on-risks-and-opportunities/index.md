The last few years have witnessed exciting developments in the field of biotechnology, driven in part by the machine learning revolution. However, as the Covid-19 pandemic shows, humanity is vulnerable to biological threats, whether natural or man-made. Biotechnological progress is increasing the risk of extreme pandemics.

To assist international policy actors in the development of sustainable technological development, we're publishing this short guide to recent developments in biotechnology.

### Risks and opportunities from biotechnology

**1-sentence summary:** Biotechnology has great potential for vaccines and medicine, but as long as we lack the political will to [implement existing clean air technologies at scale](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/28/opinion/last-pandemic.html), it also increases the likelihood of catastrophic pandemics.

**Definition:** Biotechnology refers to the design and construction of artificial biological pathways and organisms.

**Key developments:**

* [Gain-of-function (GOF) research](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/01/what-is-gain-of-function-research) attempts to improve our understanding of an organism's pathogenesis, transmissibility, and other factors
* GOF research is accelerated by breakthroughs in [protein engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_engineering) (e.g. directed evolution or [machine learning)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2)
* The recent advent of benchtop DNA synthesizers [could allow anybody to synthesize any gene sequence](https://progress.institute/preventing-the-misuse-of-dna-synthesis/)
* [CRISPR](https://www.broadinstitute.org/what-broad/areas-focus/project-spotlight/questions-and-answers-about-crispr) technologies enable the systematic editing of genes in live organisms at scale

**Opportunities from biotech:**

* [Better vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00025-4)
* [Personalized medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5586729/) and entirely new therapeutics that [go beyond current approaches](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323299396_Deep_learning_for_biology)
* Gain-of-function research can [help us understand](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-8678-1_28) the mechanics of pathogen spread better
* Better [crop resistance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sae2.12014) and [new biofuels](https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2023/nrel-launches-synthetic-biology-project-to-advance-biofuel-discovery-technologies-with-lanzatech-northwestern-and-yale.html) → decreased pesticide & fossil-fuel use

**Catastrophic risks from biotech:**

* Engineered pathogens can have worse virulence/transmissibility tradeoffs as seen in nature: they could spread faster and be deadlier
* Plummeting costs means thousands of actors may soon have access to these tools [(Esvelt, 2022, p.10)](https://dam.gcsp.ch/files/doc/gcsp-geneva-paper-29-22?_gl=1*w93j6n*_ga*MTcwODQyODI0Mi4xNjgyMDExODM2*_ga_Z66DSTVXTJ*MTY4MjI5OTgyMy4yLjAuMTY4MjI5OTgyMy4wLjAuMA..)
* Engineered pandemics could kill billions or even pose an existential risk.  The originator could be:

  * States ([bioweapons programs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1326447/))
  * Terrorists ([bioterrorism](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/C-Nelson-Engineered-Pathogens.pdf))
  * Established laboratories [(lab leaks](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/science/article/2022/11/13/virology-a-timeline-of-lab-accidents-biological-attacks-and-increasingly-dangerous-experiments_6004113_10.html))
  * Individual [‘biohackers’](https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/bio2.0/the_promises_demands_and_risks/) (DIY lab leaks)

**Governance gaps in biotech:** 

* No international framework to identify & [govern dual-use research of concern](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240036161)
* Gaps in data-sharing at the international level
* [No definitive registry](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/mapping-biosafety-level-3-laboratories-by-publications/) of [BSL-3 and BSL-4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8414973/) labs (the highest risk categories). There is no international authority monitoring these. Most incidents probably aren’t disclosed. 
* [Protocols for DNA synthesis screening](https://media.nti.org/documents/Biosecurity_Innovation_and_Risk_Reduction.pdf) differ internationally and are rarely applied by companies

**Solutions to the risks posed by biotech:** 

* Artificial Intelligence can help with solutions. For instance, [using neural nets to find risky labs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33293535/) from open-source data or [improved diagnostics](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2018/181009-gcbr-tech-report.pdf)
* [Wastewater monitoring](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01940-x) to detect the presence of pathogens
* [Pandemic test-ban treaty](https://twitter.com/mattwridley/status/1530490051020345344?lang=en-GB): ban dissemination of results from riskiest experiments 
* Work with labs to establish secure and universal DNA synthesis screening ([IBBIS](https://ibbis.bio) is doing this)
* Implementing the WHO's [global accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response](https://www.who.int/news/item/03-03-2023-countries-begin-negotiations-on-global-agreement-to-protect-world-from-future-pandemic-emergencies)
* [Implementation](https://www.un.org/disarmament/biological-weapons/national-implementation/) and [verification](https://www.nti.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Creating-a-Verification-Protocol_FINAL_June2022.pdf) mechanisms for the Biological Weapons Convention
* Reduce vulnerabilities: improve [personal protective equipment](https://www.scienceopen.com/document_file/843ff097-c837-4150-8cf4-28202299468b/ScienceOpenPreprint/preprint%20upload%20version%20of%20Innovating%20Respirators_%20PPE%20Lessons%20for%20Future%20Pandemics%20v7.1.pdf), [vaccine development](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-021-00290-y), install [germicidal low-wavelength light](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4595666/)

**Prominent case studies of risks from biotech:**

* [Dugway proving ground](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-anthrax-idUKKCN0UT1QW): a prominent ‘lab leak’ incident: the a US government lab accidentally mailed anthrax samples to labs around the country 
* [Aum Shinrikyo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-35975069) was a cult that released synthesised sarin gas into Tokyo subway in the 90s
* The Soviet [bioweapons programme](https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2012/07/soviet_bw/): cost billions of $, undetected for decades

**Prominent experts:**

* [Kevin Esvelt](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/esvelt-sandbrink)  is an expert (one of the pioneers of Crispr); he now devotes his work to reducing risks from biotechnology
* [George Church](https://futureoflife.org/podcast/on-the-future-of-computation-synthetic-biology-and-life-with-george-church/) is another founder of the field who has spoken publicly about the risks
