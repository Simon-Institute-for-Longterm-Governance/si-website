In 2024, our team worked to do our part in the broader AI governance landscape, by anticipating key developments, building coalitions, and leveraging our strategic positioning in **New York and Geneva** to advance practical policy solutions. We helped inform international AI governance frameworks, built alliances across the multilateral system, provided expert guidance on institutional design, and facilitated dialogue between the tech community and multilateral institutions.

[Our annual report](<We helped inform international AI governance frameworks>) provides an overview of our work in **2024**, covering key figures, progress on our **2023-2025 strategy**, notable achievements, and financial updates. For a high-level overview, in 2024, we: 

* Supported the **UN's Global Digital Compact (GDC) process** – an international framework establishing some of the first truly global commitments for governing digital and emerging technologies, which included, among others, an agreement to establish the **Independent International Scientific Panel on AI** and **Global Dialogue on AI Governance**.

  * We delivered **five training programs** for over **125 UN diplomats** to support their participation in the AI-related negotiations, met with more than **50 Missions** across **three trips** to New York to discuss AI governance tradeoffs, and published and submitted numerous policy recommendations informed by input from over **20 AI safety experts**.
* Supported the implementation of GDC commitments following the **Summit of the Future in September** – with a specific focus on the establishment of the Independent International Scientific Panel on AI and the Global Dialogue on AI Governance. We published one of the first reports (**["Blueprints"](https://www.simoninstitute.ch/blog/post/blueprints-design-options-for-the-independent-international-scientific-panel-on-ai-and-the-global-dialogue-on-ai-governance/)**) outlining design options for both institutions in **early December**, and travelled to New York to discuss these options with over **25 stakeholders** driving the process.
* Organized workshops and briefings for diplomats and international civil servants on **Frontier AI R&D**, **Compute Governance**, and **AI benefit-sharing**, involving experts from industry, academia, and civil society. Maintained an extensive collaboration network through **800+ calls** and dozens of speaking engagements, and coordinated a successful **[2-day workshop in Paris](https://www.simoninstitute.ch/blog/post/advancing-multilateral-ai-governance-recommendations-for-the-2025-paris-ai-action-summit/)** that generated concrete action commitments from **25 participants** ahead of the **2025 AI Action Summit**.
* Began exploring direct pathways for national engagement with key developer states and **Global South countries**, through research projects, relationship building with government representatives, and strategic meetings with national AI governance initiatives, while simultaneously strengthening connections in the **Bay Area's AI ecosystem**.
* Reinforced our organizational structure by securing **~CHF1,456,000 in funding**, expanding our team with key hires including a **Senior Tech Policy Specialist** and **Tech Policy Fellow**, enhancing our operational infrastructure through new policies and systems, and refining our brand and public communications to better position SI for continued impact in **2025 and beyond**.
