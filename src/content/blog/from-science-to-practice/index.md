We're organizing a panel on "Towards 2030: Navigating complexity and information in decision-making" as part of UNRISD's open consultation on "From Science to Practice! Research And Knowledge To Achieve The SDGs", leading up to the UN high-level political forum in July.

To achieve the 2030 Agenda, decision-makers need to deal with complexity. This session focuses on how they can benefit from behavioural science. 

In 2020, more than 100,000 academic articles have been published on COVID-19. The public, the media and civil society also covered the issue. Yet, international and national decision-makers need to make decisions under time constraints and uncertainty. The problem is not just the speed of knowledge synthesis, it is also the inherent uncertainty that comes with such stressful situations and how we cope with it.

Participants will learn about the state of the art on how best to navigate complexity and information overload, based on behavioural insights to strengthen decision-making.
