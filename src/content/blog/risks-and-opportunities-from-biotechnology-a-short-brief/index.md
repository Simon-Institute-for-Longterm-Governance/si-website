The last few years have witnessed exciting developments in the field of biotechnology, driven in part by the machine learning revolution. However, as the Covid-19 pandemic shows, humanity is vulnerable to biological threats, whether natural or anthropogenic in origin.

To assist international policy actors in the development of sustainable technological development, we're publishing a short brief as a reference. As well as constituting a guide to understanding recent rapid developments in synthetic biotechnology (specifically synthetic genomics), we will also continually update this document to maintain it as a living repository of key developments.

### Risks and opportunities from biotechnology

**1-sentence summary:** Biotechnology has great potential for vaccines and medicine, but without international governance, secure DNA synthesis screening, and improved safety protocols, it also presents the risk of engineered pandemics with catastrophic outcomes.

**Definition:** Biotechnology refers to the design and construction of novel artificial biological pathways and organisms.

**The technical details: how biotech works**

* [Crispr](https://www.broadinstitute.org/what-broad/areas-focus/project-spotlight/questions-and-answers-about-crispr) and associated gene-splicing technologies make designing genes easier
* Applying machine learning/AI (e.g AlphaFold) allows for [discovery](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2) of new proteins
* [Gain-of-function research](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/01/what-is-gain-of-function-research) is the deliberate attempt to improve pathogenesis, transmissibility or other factors. This can help improve threat models for future pandemics, but poses risks of its own if proper lab security is not maintained
* Plummeting costs means thousands of actors may soon have access to these tools [(p.10)](https://dam.gcsp.ch/files/doc/gcsp-geneva-paper-29-22?_gl=1*w93j6n*_ga*MTcwODQyODI0Mi4xNjgyMDExODM2*_ga_Z66DSTVXTJ*MTY4MjI5OTgyMy4yLjAuMTY4MjI5OTgyMy4wLjAuMA..)
* These pathogens may not have the same virulence/transmissibility tradeoff as seen in nature

**Opportunities from biotech:**

* [Better vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00025-4)
* [Personalised medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5586729/) and entirely new therapeutics that [go beyond current approaches](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323299396_Deep_learning_for_biology)
* Gain-of-function research can [help us understand](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-8678-1_28) the mechanics of pathogen spread better
* Better [crop resistance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sae2.12014) and [new biofuels](https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2023/nrel-launches-synthetic-biology-project-to-advance-biofuel-discovery-technologies-with-lanzatech-northwestern-and-yale.html) → decreased pesticide & fossil-fuel use

**Risks from biotech:**

* Engineered pathogens causing new pandemics that could kill billions or even pose an existential risk.  The originator could be:

  * States ([bioweapons programmes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1326447/))
  * Terrorists ([bioterrorism](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/C-Nelson-Engineered-Pathogens.pdf))
  * Established laboratories [(lab leaks](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/science/article/2022/11/13/virology-a-timeline-of-lab-accidents-biological-attacks-and-increasingly-dangerous-experiments_6004113_10.html))
  * Individual [‘biohackers’](https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/bio2.0/the_promises_demands_and_risks/) (DIY lab leaks)

**Governance gaps in biotech:** 

* No international framework to identify & [govern dual-use research of concern](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240036161)
* Gaps in data-sharing at the international level
* [No definitive registry](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/mapping-biosafety-level-3-laboratories-by-publications/) of [BSL-3 and BSL-4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8414973/) labs (the highest risk categories). There is no international authority monitoring these. Most incidents probably aren’t disclosed. 
* [Protocols for DNA synthesis screening](https://media.nti.org/documents/Biosecurity_Innovation_and_Risk_Reduction.pdf) differ internationally and are rarely applied by companies

**Solutions to the risks posed by biotech:** 

* Artificial Intelligence can help with solutions. For instance, [using neural nets to find risky labs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33293535/) from open-source data or [improved diagnostics](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2018/181009-gcbr-tech-report.pdf)
* [Pandemic test-ban treaty](https://twitter.com/mattwridley/status/1530490051020345344?lang=en-GB): ban dissemination of results from riskiest experiments 
* Work with labs to establish secure and universal DNA synthesis screening ([IBBIS](https://ibbis.bio) doing this)
* [Implementation](https://www.un.org/disarmament/biological-weapons/national-implementation/) and [verification](https://www.nti.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Creating-a-Verification-Protocol_FINAL_June2022.pdf) mechanisms for the Biological Weapons Convention
* Reduce vulnerabilities: improve [Personal protective equipment](https://www.scienceopen.com/document_file/843ff097-c837-4150-8cf4-28202299468b/ScienceOpenPreprint/preprint%20upload%20version%20of%20Innovating%20Respirators_%20PPE%20Lessons%20for%20Future%20Pandemics%20v7.1.pdf), [vaccine development](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-021-00290-y), install [germicidal low-wavelength light](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4595666/)

**Prominent case studies of risks from biotech:**

* [Dugway proving ground](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-anthrax-idUKKCN0UT1QW): a prominent ‘lab leak’ incident: the a US government lab accidentally mailed anthrax samples to labs around the country 
* [Aum Shinrikyo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-35975069) was a cult that released synthesised sarin gas into Tokyo subway in the 90s
* The Soviet [bioweapons programme](https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2012/07/soviet_bw/): cost billions of $, undetected for decades

**Prominent experts:**

* [Kevin Esvelt](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/esvelt-sandbrink)  is an expert (one of the pioneers of Crispr); he now devotes his work to reducing risks from biotechnology
* [George Church](https://futureoflife.org/podcast/on-the-future-of-computation-synthetic-biology-and-life-with-george-church/) is another founder of the field who has spoken publicly about the risks
