Following the release of the [Zero Draft](https://www.un.org/pga/78/2024/04/01/letter-from-president-general-assembly-on-global-digital-compact-zero-draft/) of the Global Digital Compact (GDC) on April 1, 2024, the co-facilitators of the process released a first revision ([Rev.1](https://www.un.org/techenvoy/sites/www.un.org.techenvoy/files/Global_Digital_Compact_Rev_1.pdf)) on May 15, 2024, based on Member State consultations and input. Below, we highlight the key changes made to Objective 5 (the section focused on the governance of AI and emerging technologies), discuss what these changes imply, and outline why we think they've been made.

Overall, Rev.1 of the GDC remains a reasonably high ambition text, in that it preserves almost all of the Zero Draft’s institutional proposals in objective 5 (despite the pushback from Member States during the first reading over potential duplications with existing mechanisms). The co-facilitators have also simplified the structure of objective 5 by deleting the sub-sub-sections and removing some detail from the institutional proposals. 

The key changes made to Objective 5 include the following: 

1. Weakening of the overall ambition regarding the UN's role in governing AI and emerging technologies; 
2. Addition of a new paragraph outlining key governance functions, inspired by the High-Level Advisory Body on AI’s [interim report](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/un_ai_advisory_body_governing_ai_for_humanity_interim_report.pdf);
3. Modification of the proposed 'Annual global dialogue on AI governance' to a Contact Group on AI governance;
4. Broadening the mandate of the proposed International Scientific Panel on AI to include emerging technologies;
5. Simplification and clarification of roles for the GDC's follow-up and review processes

Overall, Rev.1 of the GDC remains a reasonably high ambition text, in that it preserves almost all of the Zero Draft’s institutional proposals in objective 5 (despite the pushback from Member States during the first reading over potential duplications with existing mechanisms). The co-facilitators have also simplified the structure of objective 5 by deleting the sub-sub-sections and removing some detail from the institutional proposals. 

## Key changes to note in objective 5 + follow-up and review:

### **1. Weakening of overall ambition of the UN with regard to objective 5**

**What?** Changes to the language indicate a slightly weakened ambition, or at least a downgrade to the centrality of the UN’s role in the governance of AI and emerging technologies. For example, the title of objective 5 has become ‘Enhance international governance of…’ instead of ‘Govern…’, and paragraph 52 now refers to the GDC as a unique opportunity to ‘advance’ international governance of AI and emerging technologies, rather than ‘establish the foundations for’ it. In paragraph 51, the role of the UN is now recognized as ‘vital’ but no longer ‘central’.

**Why?** This reflects comments made by the US, UK, CANZ and Japan (and to a lesser extent the EU), indicating that they do not see (or wish) the UN to be leading international governance of AI and emerging technology, but only playing a complementary role, amongst and alongside other initiatives.

### **2. Addition of a new paragraph outlining key governance functions** 

**What?** The co-facilitators have added a new paragraph (para. 52) that outlines 3 objectives for the GDC to "advance international governance of AI and emerging technologies":

* assess future directions and implications and promote scientific consensus, 
* support compatibility, and interoperable norms, and 
* build capacities to access, develop, use and govern AI and emerging technologies for sustainable development.

This clause echoes AI governance functions 1-5 outlined in the [interim report of the HLAB on AI](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/un_ai_advisory_body_governing_ai_for_humanity_interim_report.pdf). However, Rev.1 still contains no mention of the two remaining functions identified by the HLAB on AI (6 and 7), namely monitoring and reporting of risks/incidents, and compliance and accountability.

**Why?** This addition provides a clarity of purpose that seemed to be missing in the Zero Draft, which skipped straight to the proposal of new institutions without first outlining the governance gaps to be filled. Rev.1 instead outlines what we want to do (para 52) and then how we commit to doing it (paras. 53-61). This may facilitate understanding of the overall approach and also agreement by Member States, by allowing them to negotiate the functions separately from the proposed mechanisms. 

### **3. Modification of the proposal for an ‘Annual global dialogue on AI governance’**

**What?** Rev.1 contains a proposal for an International Contact Group on AI governance (para. 53b), which replaces the Zero Draft proposal for an annual global dialogue. This Contact Group is proposed as intergovernmental, rather than multistakeholder, in nature, but its stated purpose remains similar to that of the dialogue proposed in the Zero Draft - that is, to build shared understandings on governance, risk management and safety frameworks and to promote interoperability across governance approaches. Although Rev.1 mentions that this Contact Group’s work should be “supported by multistakeholder engagement on AI governance including the annual AI for Good Summit”, this revised proposal is nevertheless a clear shift towards prioritizing intergovernmental discussions on AI governance.

**Why?** The contact group was originally a proposal from the High-Level Advisory Body on AI (HLAB) to the co-facilitators. However, in the HLAB’s proposal, the group was multistakeholder in nature, so it has been significantly altered in Rev.1. The suggestion to make the dialogue intergovernmental came from the G77. Meanwhile, other Member States did not seem aligned over whether a new mechanism was needed at all (with suggestions to instead rely on IGF, OECD, UNESCO’s Global Forum or ITU’s AI for Good), and what the dialogue should do. The changes in Rev.1 could be the  co-facilitators’ way of clarifying that the intent is to create something fundamentally different from existing efforts and that this function is not something that should be subsumed by IGF or any other existing body. It is also worth mentioning that this Contact Group does not have any clear output. This will likely be for the next set of co-facilitators to work on (para. 54), but it would already be worth thinking about what outputs from such a group could be maximally useful, even if this is not specified in the GDC text. 

**Note:** The choice of a “Contact Group” to fulfill this function is interesting, given that such groups are traditionally formed to help manage peace and security crises (although there are some recent examples that go beyond this domain). The SI team will do more research on the significance and impact of such contact groups and how best to leverage this proposal.

### **4. Broadening of the mandate of the international Scientific Panel**

**What?** In the Zero Draft, the Panel was on AI only, but in Rev.1, it has become the International Scientific Panel on AI and Emerging Technology. Some of the detail of what it will do has been removed. For example, Rev.1 states that the Panel will issue reports, but the six-monthly reporting cycle is gone. Also gone is the mention of providing ‘early warning’. Meanwhile the new task of contributing to ‘mitigation measures’ has been added.

**Why?** The addition of ‘emerging technologies’ is forward looking and will allow for the panel to adapt its work and relevance to future technological developments. This sentiment is reflected elsewhere in Rev.1 which, in several places, seems to have broadened the focus from AI only to AI and emerging technologies (e.g. in para. 52), as a response to suggestions from Member States. The diminished level of detail in terms of what the Panel will do likely aims to make it easier for Member States to agree on the fundamentals only (ie. that this is a governance gap to be filled), leaving the modalities and terms of reference to be proposed later on. This will provide more time for Member States time to think through what institutional design will be most fit-for-purpose. 

### **5. Simplification and clearer roles for GDC follow-up and review**

**What?** The final section of Rev.1 contains a few changes that are relevant to the governance of AI and emerging technologies, as well as more broadly. 

For one thing, there is a subtly increased insistence on strengthening / leveraging multistakeholder platforms (additions in paras. 63 and 66) and the WSIS Forum in particular. 

There is also a noticeable effort to simplify the follow-up procedures, with the deletion of a reference to a new reporting portal for Member States (para. 72) and the proposal for a high-level meeting  to review the GDC seemingly becoming a one-off meeting, instead of taking place every two-years.

The new language also provides greater clarity in terms of the envisaged roles of WSIS and IGF. The mention of ‘adapting WSIS action lines’ has been deleted from para. 69, as have the specific mentions of ‘internet governance’ in para. 73 on the IGF. Instead, there is a suggestion for IGF to add an ‘annual policy discussion track’ on GDC implementation.

**Why?** The simplification of follow-up procedures responds to calls from Member States to make maximal use of existing structures and to delete the paragraph on the reporting portal. Regarding WSIS and IGF, comments from Member States on the Zero Draft demonstrated differing opinions on the roles of WSIS and IGF and how important they should be in implementation and follow-up. Rev.1 seems to have tried to clarify what the vision is for these entities. The change with regard to WSIS reflects, perhaps, a recommendation for the WSIS+20 review to specifically not reopen the core WSIS texts, but use what is already there in its current form. On the other hand, where IGF is concerned, deleting the references to ‘internet governance’ seems to broaden the envisaged role of IGF, implying that it is relevant to all digital issues and should take a full and active role in GDC implementation as a kind of multistakeholder oversight body. 

**Other things to note:**

* The proposal for a Global Fund for AI and Emerging Technology remains almost identical to the zero draft. This could be due to the EU and G77 reserving the clause in the zero-draft consultations. We expect it to be debated (and possibly modified) during the upcoming negotiations.
* The proposal for an Office within the UN Secretariat for digital and emerging technologies is also not substantially changed, although Rev.1 makes it explicit that this would be an institutionalization of OSET, and also deletes the mention of a presence of this office in Geneva.

In conclusion, at least as far as the governance of AI and emerging technology is concerned, this Rev.1 is a step in the right direction as it simplifies and re-structures, without substantially reducing the ambition of the Zero Draft. This will provide more time for Member States to process the institutional proposals and get ready for the line-by-line negotiations in a few weeks.
