On February 6th and 7th 2024, the Simon Institute for Longterm Governance (SI) organized two full-day training courses on AI governance for Permanent Missions to the United Nations (UN) in New York, in collaboration with the Permanent Mission of Costa Rica and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). The training courses welcomed 60 diplomats in total, 55% of which were from the Global South. 

The training courses sought to brief Member State representatives on the technical foundations of AI, AI’s opportunities and risks, and the role of the multilateral system in addressing AI governance. It provided an occasion for diplomats to strengthen their knowledge on these topics, and debate them with their peers, in preparation for the upcoming negotiations of the UN’s Global DIgital Compact (GDC).

Each training course featured a mix of presentations, discussions, Q&As, and interactive segments, covering four key categories: 

* Technical primer on AI
* AI opportunities and risks
* Overview of the current AI governance landscape 
* The role of the UN in AI governance 

The accompanying briefing note for the training course can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_OQXjDgxr25DASh8TLhgViLyAq7BdZc0/view?usp=sharing). 

The first session, on AI’s technical foundations, covered the building blocks of AI (algorithms, data and compute), the different types of AI, and AI’s development trajectory. It included a discussion and Q&A with Lewis Ho from Google DeepMind, who spoke about the private sector’s role in AI development, and answered questions on how data quality affects AI systems, where bias comes from and how to deal with it, risks of open-source AI models, and the difference between AI applications and foundation models. 

The second session explored AI’s opportunities and risks. It provided specific examples of opportunities, including enhanced healthcare via AI-driven diagnostic systems and improved disaster preparedness via AI-powered early warning systems; as well as some examples of risks, such as AI generated media fueling political instability and the potential loss of control over AI systems. Following the presentation, participants engaged in scenario-building exercises, where they were assigned scenarios based on different AI trajectories, and tasked with discussing the associated opportunities and risks.

The third session provided an overview of the current AI governance landscape, looking at factors that make AI difficult to govern, noteworthy national, regional and international AI governance initiatives, different approaches to AI governance (hard law vs soft law), and various proposals for new international institutions to govern AI. The session ended with an interactive segment where participants were prompted to think about what kinds of institutional functions are needed to govern AI (e.g. knowledge production, monitoring, standards setting, etc.) 

The final session explored the role of the UN in governing AI, and provided an overview of existing AI-related UN bodies, processes, and initiatives, such as the GDC and the High Level Advisory Body on AI. The presentation was followed by a Q&A with Renata Dwan, Special Adviser to the Office of the Secretary General’s Envoy on Technology, and an interactive segment where participants outlined what they’d like to see achieved via the GDC. 

Moving forward, SI plans to continue supporting member states with capacity building on AI governance, while also supporting efforts feeding into the GDC.
