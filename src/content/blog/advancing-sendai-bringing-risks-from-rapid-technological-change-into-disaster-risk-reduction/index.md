Throughout 2022 and early 2023, [the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction](https://www.undrr.org/publication/sendai-framework-disaster-risk-reduction-2015-2030) underwent a period of review. During this time, multilateral actors were invited to re-examine current approaches to understanding, governing, and preventing risks.
