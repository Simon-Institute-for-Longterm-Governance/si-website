As part of the UN's Our Common Agenda, an intergovernmental process on digital issues has been put in place between the Office of the Technology Envoy and the General Assembly co-facilitators Rwanda and Sweden. This consultative process aims to agree on a roadmap for a ‘Global Digital Compact’ oulining international responses to digital developments.

The GDC represents a significant step forward in building multilateral capacity to deal with some of the great technological questions of our age, including the rapid rise of artificial intelligence. The Simon Institute consulted various stakeholders from the private sector, academia, and civil society on AI safety and governance. We participated in the Future of Life’s consultation process and consulted with Chinese collaborators to ensure international coherence. Finally, we analyzed the existing submissions to the GDC to see where we could best fill knowledge gaps and settled on the governance of foundation models.

Outside of our GDC-specific workstream, we have also convened several workshops and discussions on the impacts and governance of advanced artificial intelligence. Our [submission to the GDC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X4-yEzofsygKHndYiE5x8Kf3xnyZpRjs/view?usp=share_link) synthesizes our GDC-specific and general efforts to engage diverse stakeholders on AI governance issues. 

### Summary

In the last 6 months, the Simon Institute for Longterm Governance held three workshops with diverse audiences on future-proofing the UN. Recommending a focus on AI governance to the Global Digital Compact was identified as important. After conducting an analysis of other submissions and consulting all key stakeholder groups, a focus on the governance of foundation models appeared important. These powerful AI systems cannot currently be reliably aligned with human values, unless increased investment in interpretability research makes these black-box algorithms more accessible.

**Principles**

1. The GDC should emphasize the convergence of problems and solutions in AI regulation, and thus advocate for the development of reliable interpretability tools.
2. The GDC should balance expertise with democratic input, engaging with private sector and academia while ensuring citizens have a say in designing the future.
3. The GDC should advocate for accountability of foundation models, as current regulation  is insufficient to establish liability for harms caused.
4. The GDC should advocate risk-informed development for advanced AI at international, national, and local levels.

**Recommendations**

1. UN AI capacity-building program: Offer scholarships for experts from low- and middle-income countries to improve AI expertise at leading AI centres, and hire experts for forecasting AI capabilities, opportunities, and harms.
2. International consensus on AI auditing: Advocate for international coordination of AI auditing organizations through a multilateral forum, similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Regulatory Cooperation Forum.
3. Prioritize international cooperation on sharing AI incidents: Promote public sharing of incidents, adopt interoperable standards for reporting AI incidents, and support whistleblowing rights for those who work on advanced AI systems.
4. Interoperable standards for safe AI: Use standard-setting bodies to promote international collaboration on safety standards that respect member states’ diverging values and regulatory frameworks while remaining interoperable. Private-sector innovation can also provide input.
