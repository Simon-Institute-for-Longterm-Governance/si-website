The Executive Office of the Secretary-General (EOSG) of the United Nations is publishing a series of policy briefs to inform the Our Common Agenda processes. On March 9th 2023, EOSG published its first two policy briefs on [Future Generations](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-future-generations-en.pdf) and [The Emergency Platform](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-emergency-platform-en.pdf).

The Simon Institute for Longterm Governance teamed up with [Riesgos Catastróficos Globales](https://riesgoscatastroficosglobales.com/) to review the policy briefs and provide substantial input to contribute to the impact of these efforts. 

### General comments on the Emergency Platform

The Emergency Platform could be a valuable mechanism to help coordinate complex global shocks that require inter-institutional cooperation and **urgent decision-making** that can respond to complex crises, and prevent shock cascades.

This mechanism would **complement and coordinate** the actions of regional and sectoral organizations, unlocking cross-systems capacity and support without impeding on the mandates of existing institutions. We encourage the Emergency Platform to *empower* existing institutions to act during crises rather than replace them. The Emergency Platform should in particular **coordinate with funding mechanisms** to provide rapid and effective resource allocation.

The Emergency Platform should be developed soon, as the rate of global crises is likely increasing. Its protocols should be **carefully crafted to quickly and aptly address global crises.** 

While an Emergency Platform could be instrumental in addressing global shocks, it is reactive in nature. It is essential to **complement this mechanism with prevention mechanisms,** particularly regarding existential risks, which by definition, cannot be reacted to. Such mechanisms should be considered in separate proposals to ensure that the Emergency Platform mandate remains narrow and effective.

### Practical suggestions for the Emergency Platform

The policy brief on the Emergency Platform cites types of global shocks to address, such as large-scale climate disruptions or future pandemics. This list should be **complemented with risks from artificial intelligence and abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios,** such as volcanic or nuclear winters. Most importantly, the Emergency Platform should not over-focus on selected types of crises such that it can preserve its flexibility in the future. 

The [risk governance assessment framework](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/irgc/concepts-and-frameworks/risk-governance-framework/) of the International Risk Governance Center could provide a **conceptual basis** to determine when to trigger the protocols of the Emergency Platform. The protocols should also account for shocks that may be [slow-moving](https://irgc.org/risk-governance/preparing-for-future-catastrophes/) and thus barely noticeable for a long-time and impossible or extremely costly to respond to when they manifest. 

The protocols of the Emergency Platform should be **easy to operationalize**. We, therefore, recommend a reconceptualization of “complex global shock” as a function of **reach** (how many individuals and sectors are affected) and **severity** (how badly they are affected), making “complexity” and “scale” redundant, and allowing for an easier quantification of [systemic risks](https://irgc.org/risk-governance/systemic-risks/).

For the key principles of the Emergency Platform, we recommend simplifying them into three principles to reduce possible confusion: **committed, integrated, and agile.** Commitment requires accountability and resourcing; while integration necessarily requires multisector coordination, interdisciplinarity, solidarity and inclusion.

### Complementing the Emergency Platform with prevention 

To complement the work of the Emergency Platform, the Futures Lab could conduct the **necessary monitoring** to forecast potential future shocks and important decisions to be made. In case of urgency, it could then convene a preventative decision-making platform to analyze trade-offs and facilitate the convergence of stakeholders for proactive prevention.

The international community must recognize **the potential of Global South countries** to take a leading role in preventing and mitigating global shocks, as well as innovating in priority areas. For example, Latin America could become a leading region for responding to an abrupt sun-reducing scenario in which the atmosphere is clouded by a large amount of particulate matter causing [multi-year reductions in global temperature which could lead to an agricultural collapse.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00573-0)

Member states should **invest in improving risk assessment capacities,** particularly in low and middle-income countries, in a cost-effective way and promote appropriate and efficacious methodologies to respond to catastrophic tail risks that could cause global disaster.
