      * Salary: CHF 96,000 – 122,000. We consider a variety of factors when formulating an offer, including but not limited to, the role and responsibilities, work experience, training, skills, expertise, and internal equity. We’re willing to review the salary range for exceptional candidates.

      * Start date: As soon as possible, with a strong preference to start before April.

      * Hours: Full-time, flexible hours, and occasional travel.

      * Location: In-person in Geneva.

      * Employment: Permanent employment with a 3-month probation period.

      * Office: We have a well-equipped office in Geneva, and we will pay for high-quality ergonomic equipment (laptop, monitors, etc.).

      * Generous vacation: 35 days of holiday each year, plus public holidays. We encourage you to use the full allowance.

      * Team retreats and conferences: We hold in-person staff retreats twice a year, to work on our strategy and build strong working relationships.

      * Parental leave and support: We offer maternity and paternity benefits that go beyond Swiss legal requirements: this includes up to 6 months of maternity leave, 60 days of flexible paternity leave, 100% salary coverage during leave, flexibility to work from home, unlimited breastfeeding breaks, parental PTO for childhood difficulties, and the option to work at 80% while being paid 100% in the first year after childbirth.

      * Fitness: We reimburse fitness expenses of up to CHF 600 per year for full-time employees and proportionately for part-time employees.


      If you enjoy supporting people, planning, and juggling many different tasks, we think you’d add a lot of value to our team. This role offers unique insight into SI’s structure, priorities, and decisions. The ideal candidate brings a strong alignment with our mission and culture, as well as:

      * strong problem-solving and system-building skills; 

      * comfort with ambiguity and self-direction; and 

      * a strong preference for quick iteration through direct feedback.


      We’re a small team and care deeply about our supportive culture. We strive for excellence and encourage high ambitions. We want you to succeed in your career and feel supported to grow.


      *The above list of duties contains the main duties and responsibilities for this position. However, in a small organization such as SI, staff members are expected to show flexibility in their approach to work and be willing to undertake other tasks that are reasonably allocated to them, but which may not be part of their regular list of duties. Whereas any task becomes a regular part of an employee’s responsibilities, the job description will be changed in consultation with the employee and their supervisor.*

        ### Application process

      * Submit the [application form](https://airtable.com/appLN90cujuQSnA5M/pag1xYu2HOdHZY0W6/form). We expect this application form to take 30-60 minutes to fill in. Please do not spend more than an hour on it. We review candidates on a rolling basis and will close this round on March 16th.

      * Complete 1-2 work tests designed to simulate the work you would do if hired and/or evaluate certain skills important for success in the role.

      * Attend a remote interview.

      * Attend a paid trial day (in-person) to allow you and us to see what it would be like if you worked at SI. 

      * Submit references.

      * Receive an employment offer!


      There’s no such thing as a “perfect” candidate. If you’re on the fence about applying because you’re unsure whether you’re qualified, we’d encourage you to apply.


      It’s really important that all candidates who have the potential to succeed at SI are provided with an equitable experience in the application process. So, if you require adjustments to provide you with the best opportunity to succeed through our hiring process, please let us know at any stage.
