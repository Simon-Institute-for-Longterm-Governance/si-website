    content: >
      Founded in 2021 and based in Geneva, Switzerland, the Simon Institute for Longterm Governance (SI) works to support the governance of emerging technologies and existential risks, building on Herbert Simon's vision of future-proof policymaking processes. Operating at the interface of science and policy, SI synthesizes research and connects thought leaders to decision-makers. 


      SI’s work is focused on the multilateral system as a key catalyst for global cooperation, which is necessary for humanity to flourish sustainably. Being embedded in international Geneva and the wider Swiss foreign policy community, SI supports Switzerland in its role as the global hub driving a scientific multilateralism focused on furthering universal values.
