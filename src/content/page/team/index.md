      ### Martina Kunz

      Martina is a Research Fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence and a PhD Candidate at the Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance, University of Cambridge. Her research focuses on the intersection between international law and artificial intelligence. Before Cambridge, Martina studied and worked at the University of Geneva, Tsinghua University, and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. She is passionate about open data, free and open source software, data science, automation, natural language processing and machine learning as tools to improve international governance and coordination on global challenges facing us in both the near- and long-term.

      ### Igor Linkov

      Igor is Senior Science and Technology Manager at the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), and Adjunct Professor with Carnegie Mellon University. He is responsible for ERDC’s project portfolio in the areas of crisis management and resilience. Igor has developed methods and tools for measuring resilience in interconnected networks and applied these tools to transportation networks, energy infrastructure, cyber systems, supply chains and to manage response and recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. He has organized more than thirty conferences and continuing education workshops and publishes widely on risk and resilience analysis, including twenty five books and over 400 peer-reviewed publications in top journals like Nature, Nature Nanotechnology and Nature Climate Change. Igor is Elected Fellow with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Society for Risk Analysis and has received multiple awards for his scientific achievements. He completed his postdoctoral training in Risk Assessment at Harvard University and served as the US Embassy Science Fellow at the US Mission to the OECD in 2017.

      ### Catherine Rhodes

      Catherine is Executive Director of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, and Senior Research Associate with the Biosecurity Research Initiative at St Catharine’s College (BioRISC). Her work broadly focuses on understanding the intersection and combination of risk stemming from technologies and risk stemming from governance (or lack of it). Catherine has particular expertise in international governance of biotechnology, biosecurity and broader biological risk management issues. She has a background in international relations and engages in extensive interdisciplinary work. Her PhD was funded as part of a Project to Strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention at the Bradford Disarmament Research Centre, and she retains a strong interest in international actions to prevent misuse of bioscience. This includes contributions to projects on the development of biosecurity and ethics education and on improving science and technology review in the biological and chemical weapons control regimes. Catherine worked for the Institute for Science, Ethics and Innovation at Manchester University from 2008-2015, where her work included: elaborating the meaning and content of scientific responsibility at the global level; investigation of science advisory processes in international organisations; and a substantial study of the international governance of genetic resources, which has significant implications for the use of biosciences in managing major global challenges.
