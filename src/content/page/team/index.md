      ### Ralph Hertwig

      Ralph is the director of the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. His research interests lie in models of bounded and ecological rationality, decisions from experience, the psychology of risk, lifespan development of decision-making and evidence-based public policy (boosting). He is a member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and of the Wilhelm-Wundt-Gesellschaft. He is a fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and the Max Planck School of Cognition. He holds faculty positions at the International Max Planck Research School on the Life Course and at the International Max Planck Research School for Computational Methods in Psychiatry and Ageing Research. He has recently published two books directly relevant to SI's work: "Taming Uncertainty" (MIT Press, 2019) and "Deliberate Ignorance: Choosing not to know" (MIT Press, 2020).

      ### Konstantinos Katsikopoulos

      Konstantinos is associate professor and head of research at the Department of Decision Analytics and Risk of the University of Southampton Business School. His research focuses on integrating standard decision models with people’s simple rules of thumb, in order to build theory fit for practice, as detailed in the book "Classification in the Wild: The Science and Art of Transparent Decision Making" (MIT Press, 2020). Konstantinos is the chair of the Behavioural Operational Research (OR) Group of the OR Society, designed the first Europe-wide PhD course on behavioural OR, and co-founded the Annual Winter School on Bounded Rationality in India. He has been visiting assistant professor at MIT and deputy director at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, and held a German Science Foundation Fellowship for Young Researchers. Konstantinos' group has developed tools for identifying threats at security checkpoints in Afghanistan while minimising civilian casualties, regulating UK investment banks without curbing financial innovation, and predicting the incidence of influenza in the US more robustly than big data.

      ### Martina Kunz

      Martina is a Research Fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence and a PhD Candidate at the Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance, University of Cambridge. Her research focuses on the intersection between international law and artificial intelligence. Before Cambridge, Martina studied and worked at the University of Geneva, Tsinghua University, and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. She is passionate about open data, free and open source software, data science, automation, natural language processing and machine learning as tools to improve international governance and coordination on global challenges facing us in both the near- and long-term.

      ### Igor Linkov

      Igor is Senior Science and Technology Manager at the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), and Adjunct Professor with Carnegie Mellon University. He is responsible for ERDC’s project portfolio in the areas of crisis management and resilience. Igor has developed methods and tools for measuring resilience in interconnected networks and applied these tools to transportation networks, energy infrastructure, cyber systems, supply chains and to manage response and recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. He has organized more than thirty conferences and continuing education workshops and publishes widely on risk and resilience analysis, including twenty five books and over 400 peer-reviewed publications in top journals like Nature, Nature Nanotechnology and Nature Climate Change. Igor is Elected Fellow with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Society for Risk Analysis and has received multiple awards for his scientific achievements. He completed his postdoctoral training in Risk Assessment at Harvard University and served as the US Embassy Science Fellow at the US Mission to the OECD in 2017.

      ### Catherine Rhodes

      Catherine is Executive Director of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, and Senior Research Associate with the Biosecurity Research Initiative at St Catharine’s College (BioRISC). Her work broadly focuses on understanding the intersection and combination of risk stemming from technologies and risk stemming from governance (or lack of it). Catherine has particular expertise in international governance of biotechnology, biosecurity and broader biological risk management issues. She has a background in international relations and engages in extensive interdisciplinary work. Her PhD was funded as part of a Project to Strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention at the Bradford Disarmament Research Centre, and she retains a strong interest in international actions to prevent misuse of bioscience. This includes contributions to projects on the development of biosecurity and ethics education and on improving science and technology review in the biological and chemical weapons control regimes. Catherine worked for the Institute for Science, Ethics and Innovation at Manchester University from 2008-2015, where her work included: elaborating the meaning and content of scientific responsibility at the global level; investigation of science advisory processes in international organisations; and a substantial study of the international governance of genetic resources, which has significant implications for the use of biosciences in managing major global challenges.

      ### Konrad Seifert

      Konrad is co-founder and chief operating officer of SI. He is responsible for our operations, internal culture, partnerships, communications and events. Together with Max, he implements our vision and delivers products. Previously, he co-founded and directed Effective Altruism Geneva, where he managed fundraising and operations, coached fellows and gave workshops and talks on effective giving, high-impact career planning, epistemology, longtermism and group rationality at universities, companies and international organizations. His interests lie in game theory, evolutionary theory, longevity, population ethics and psychology. After dropping out of a bachelor’s in international relations, he is now pursuing a B.Sc. in mathematical-technical software development from the FernUniversität Hagen.

      ### Maxime Stauffer

      Max is co-founder and chief executive officer of SI. He is responsible for our strategy, trainings and research. Together with Konrad, he maintains partnerships and evaluates performance. Max is also a research fellow at the Global Studies Institute at the University of Geneva and science-policy officer at the Geneva Science-Policy Interface. Before, he co-founded the Social Complexity Lab and Effective Altruism Geneva, where he still serves on the board. In the past, he was a researcher at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, advised the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre on evidence-based policy-making, and obtained a Bachelor’s degree in International Relations from the University of Geneva. In parallel to his work, Max is pursuing an M.Sc. in Computational Maths at Johns Hopkins University. His research interests revolve around decision-making in the face of complexity, including bounded-rationality and collective decision-making in policy contexts.
